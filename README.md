# Gopher-Bot
Discord bot made in Go by me using the DiscordGo API.

Using the discordgo library [https://www.github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo]

# To compile:

1) Download the Go compiler from http://golang.org
2) Go to the location of the source files
3) Type `go build` [I'd advise against `go run` because you have to use a token to run the bot correctly.]
4) Continue to running the bot.

# To run the bot for yourself;

1) Make a discord app
2) Make the discord app a bot
3) Take the token from the app and put it in a .bat or a .sh like this: Gopher-Bot[.exe] -t TOKENHERE
4) Use an OAuth2 Generator to get an invite link
5) Invite to your server and wammo!
